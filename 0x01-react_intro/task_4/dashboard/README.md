# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To deploy a React application using create-react-app to GitHub Pages, you can follow these steps:

Make sure your application is ready to be deployed. You can do this by running npm run build in your terminal while in the root directory of your React application. This will create a build folder with optimized production-ready files.

Install the gh-pages package by running npm install gh-pages in your terminal. This package is used to deploy the React application to GitHub Pages.

Add the following properties to your package.json file:

json
Copy code
"homepage": "https://<github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/",
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
Replace <github-username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with the name of the repository you want to deploy. These properties define the URL where your application will be deployed and the commands to run to deploy it.

Commit your changes and push them to the remote repository.

Run npm run deploy in your terminal. This will create a gh-pages branch and push the production-ready files to it.

Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update, then go to https://<github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/ in your web browser. Your React application should now be deployed and accessible at this URL.

That's it! You have successfully deployed your React application to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages branch and create-react-app.
